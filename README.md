# Portfolio

My personal portfolio website made with HTML, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and GSAP.

## Usage

To make updates to the website, download the repository and run the following commands:<br><br>
`npm install`<br><br>
`npm run scss-watch` and `npm run tailwind-watch` in separate terminals<br><br>
This will watch for changes in the SCSS and Tailwind CSS files and automatically compile them to CSS.<br>
And open the website with Live Server.
